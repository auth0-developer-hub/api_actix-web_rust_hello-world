# Hello World API: Actix Web + Rust Sample

You can use this sample project to learn how to secure a simple [Actix Web](https://actix.rs) API server using Auth0.

The `starter` branch offers a working API server that exposes three public endpoints. Each endpoint returns a different type of message: public, protected, and admin.

The goal is to use Auth0 to only allow requests that contain a valid access token in their authorization header to access the protected and admin data. Additionally, only access tokens that contain a `read:admin-messages` permission should access the admin data, which is referred to as [Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)](https://auth0.com/docs/authorization/rbac/).

[Check out the `add-authorization` branch]() to see authorization in action using Auth0.

[Check out the `add-rbac` branch]() to see authorization and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in action using Auth0.

## Get Started

The recommended way to install Rust is via [Rustup](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup), follow the instructions [here](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

Install the [toolchain](https://rust-lang.github.io/rustup/concepts/toolchains.html):

```bash
rustup toolchain install 1.56
```

Install the project dependencies:

```bash
cargo build
```

Copy the `.env.example` file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Run the project:

```bash
cargo run
```

## API Endpoints

The API server defines the following endpoints:

### ðŸ”“ Get public message

```bash
GET /api/messages/public
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "api": "api_actix-web_rust_hello-world",
  "branch": "starter",
  "text": "The starter API doesn't require an access token to share this public message."
}
```

### ðŸ”“ Get protected message

> You need to protect this endpoint using Auth0.

```bash
GET /api/messages/protected
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "api": "api_actix-web_rust_hello-world",
  "branch": "starter",
  "text": "The starter API doesn't require an access token to share this protected message."
}
```

### ðŸ”“ Get admin message

> You need to protect this endpoint using Auth0 and Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).

```bash
GET /api/messages/admin
```

#### Response

```bash
Status: 200 OK
```

```json
{
  "api": "api_actix-web_rust_hello-world",
  "branch": "starter",
  "text": "The starter API doesn't require an access token to share this admin message."
}
```

## Error Handling

### 400s errors

#### Response

```bash
Status: Corresponding 400 status code
```

```json
{
  "message": "Message that describes the error that took place."
}
```

### 500s errors

#### Response
